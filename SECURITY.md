If you discover a security vulnerability in Bucket, please send an email to <code>admin (at) weirdgloop.org</code> with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue. We'll send you some RuneScape Wiki merch (probably a scarf!) and possibly a bug bounty payout.

Bug bounty payouts are solely at Weird Gloop's discretion, but will usually range between $200 and $2000, depending on the severity and type of vulnerability, and the level of access required to exploit it.

**Examples of high-severity vulnerabilities:**
* Leak of credentials or user data
* SQL injection
* Remote code execution/Privilege escalation

**Examples of moderate-severity vulnerabilities:**
* Cross-site scripting
* Denial-of-service

Bugs in Bucket code that are not security vulnerabilities won't be eligible for the bug bounty program, but we appreciate reports on [GitHub](https://github.com/weirdgloop/mediawiki-extensions-Bucket/issues). You are welcome to test your vulnerability on our [dev wiki](https://en_rsmetawiki.dev.weirdgloop.org/). Please '''do not''' test exploits on our production wikis (runescape.wiki, minecraft.wiki, etc).

Security vulnerabilities in other code used by Weird Gloop (including MediaWiki core, non-Weird Gloop extensions, and other non-Bucket extensions developed by Weird Gloop) are not currently eligible for bug bounty payouts, but if you discover a vulnerability that affects us, we'd still like to hear from you.
